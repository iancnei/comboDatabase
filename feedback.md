##Comments
This is amazing work, Ian.  Your code is elegant, well considered, and extremely efficient.  When code reads like a story, you know it is quality.  The only thing I would recommend is an increase in seed data for your db.  Change your 'under construction' links to be either grey or strikethrough instead of alerting every time a user clicks on the links.  I am extremely proud of your work, you have done a really great job!
